**Deep Learning Practices**

This repository contains my implementations and exercises for Deep Learning, applied on real datasets (mostly from Kaggle and other open sources).
The goal is to build a strong foundation in deep learning step by step.

**Introduction & Preliminaries** → Setup, math basics, data handling,preprocessing

**Linear Regression** → From scratch & PyTorch, MSE loss, SGD on Kaggle datasets

**Linear Classification** → Softmax, cross-entropy, accuracy metrics
