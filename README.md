# Deep_Learning-Practices
This repository documents my structured journey in learning the fundamentals of Deep Learning.  
It contains a series of small projects, experiments, and notes that cover essential topics step by step.  
All implementations are done in **PyTorch**, with a focus on understanding the theory behind each concept as well as applying it in practice.

Topics covered:
1. **Introduction** – Overview of deep learning and its applications.  
2. **Preliminaries** – Math background and PyTorch basics (tensors, operations, data handling).  
3. **Linear Neural Networks for Regression** – Implementing linear regression, MSE loss, and gradient descent.  
4. **Linear Neural Networks for Classification** – Logistic regression, Softmax, CrossEntropy loss, and MNIST classification.
