**Deep Learning Practices**

This repository contains my implementations and exercises from the book Dive into Deep Learning (D2L), applied on real datasets (mostly from Kaggle and other open sources).
The goal is to build a strong foundation in deep learning step by step.

Chapter 1 – Linear Regression
Implemented linear regression on real-world data (Kaggle datasets) to predict continuous values.

Chapter 2 – Linear Classification (Manual Implementation)
Built linear classifiers from scratch using only Numpy to understand the math behind deep learning.

Chapter 3 – Linear Classification (PyTorch Implementation)
Re-implemented linear classification using PyTorch modules, training loops, and evaluation metrics.
