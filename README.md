**Deep Learning Practices**

This repository is part of my deep learning journey — documenting the key concepts I’ve learned step by step while studying Deep Learning.
The focus is not only on theoretical concepts but also on implementing models with real datasets from Kaggle, ensuring practical understanding through experiments.

**Topics Covered**

**Introduction** – Basics of Deep Learning

**Preliminaries** – Python, PyTorch, tensors, data preprocessing

**Linear Neural Networks for Regression** – Linear regression, MSE loss, training

**Linear Neural Networks for Classification** – Softmax, Cross-Entropy, evaluation metrics
