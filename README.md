**Deep Learning Practices**

This repository contains my implementations and exercises from the book Dive into Deep Learning (D2L), applied on real datasets (mostly from Kaggle and other open sources).
The goal is to build a strong foundation in deep learning step by step.

**Introduction & Preliminaries** → Setup, math basics, data handling

**Linear Regression** → From scratch & PyTorch, MSE loss, SGD on Kaggle datasets

**Linear Classification** → Softmax, cross-entropy, accuracy metrics
